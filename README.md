# What Is This:

This is my configuration for NixOS that I run on my PCs. The objective of this
configuration is to be minimal and performant enough to run on weaker hardware,
but also be powerful and beautiful enough to run on excellent hardware. This way
I can have the same operating system on any computer, which aligns perfectly
with the NixOS tenet of reproducibility. It is a fully featured and modern
desktop operating system designed for programming, office use, and gaming.
